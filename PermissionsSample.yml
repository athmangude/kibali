api: Microsoft Graph
notes:  | 
          I want to be able to see what schemes are supported.  Ideally all of them are.
          Optimize for small number of paths, not large number of paths.
          Optimize for creating new permission, not adding to existing one
          Must not try to describe API capabilites. That is done elsewhere.
          The permissions describe what a client is allowed to do from a consent perspective, it does not guarantee all combinations are possible
          A permission should provide the same access regardless of token type, assuming the token type is valid for the resource
          delegated-personal and delegated-work should behave identically

permissions:
  User.Read.All: 
    schemes:
      - delegated-work
      - application
    methods: [GET, HEAD, OPTIONS]
    paths:
      - /me
      - /users
      - /users/{userId}

  MailboxSettings.Read: 
    methods: [GET, HEAD, OPTIONS]
    schemes:
      - delegated-personal
      - delegated-work
    paths:
      - /me/mailboxSettings
      - /users/{userId}/mailboxSettings

  MailboxSettings.Read.All: 
    methods: [GET, HEAD, OPTIONS]
    schemes:
      - delegated-work
      - application
    paths:
      - /me/mailboxSettings
      - /users/{userId}/mailboxSettings

  User.ReadWrite.All: 
    methods: [ GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE ]
    schemes:
      - delegated-personal
      - delegated-work
      - application
    paths:
      - /me
      - /users
      - /users/{userId}

  User.ReadWrite: 
    methods: [ GET,PUT,PATCH,DELETE ]
    paths:
      - /me
      - /users/{currentIdentity}
    identities:
      - delegated-personal
      - delegated-work

  User.Read: 
    methods: [ GET ]
    paths:
      - /users
      - /users/{currentIdentity}
    identities:
      - delegated-personal
      - delegated-work
